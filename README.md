## assign_tasks

This exercise inputs a dictionary of {"people":list-of-can-do-tasks},
outputs the person-tasks assigned in maximum matching, i.e., most people 
doing tasks and most tasks get done.

At this time we run the 4 typical case scenarios. Will add a front-end to 
allow input of more cases to test and/or verify.

## 8queens

This is the classic 8 queens problem. On an 8 by 8 chess board we are to

That is, no two of them are on the same line, same column, or same diagonal
line.
